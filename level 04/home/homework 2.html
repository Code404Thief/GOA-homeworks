<p>game development is the process of creating and programming a game, with its achievements its models, animations, etc. basically creating an app where you can play and move and do stuff</p>
<p>AI in long form artificial intelligence is a non human bot that creates whatever you ask or desire, it can make some mistakes but its still helpful, it is used today more than ever, whether it will be help with programming making art or any other funny imagination you can come up with</p>
<p>web development is similiar to game development that I wrote but you create webs and program their design, for whatever you want to create it for it could be for fun for selling for games anything that you want but it will require lots of programming and hard work, it falls down to front-end and back-end</p>
<p>front-end is the design of the website or whatever you desire to create, its the element that makes website have a certain style and add photos in certain places and edit buttons and colors of the website, mostly written in c++</p>
<p>while the back-end is the code you write to add texts and add buttons, where the text will be located</p>
