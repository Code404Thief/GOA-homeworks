#flexbox is tool we can use in css for webpages which is used for two main elements how to put the elements horizontal or vertical and hw to alocate space between elements(ჯერ არ გვისწავლია მაინცდამაინც ეს)
#to use flexbox we first need to type displayflex which makes it flexbox then we use flex direction for the direction we need. for example row, row reverse, column. column reverse, after that justify content and align items comes in
#justify contents- flex start ,flex end, center, space between, space around
#align items- flex start flex end da center
#it is useful and its fast so it makes the use of flexbox better
